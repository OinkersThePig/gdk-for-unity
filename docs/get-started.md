# Get started: Introduction

Get started with SpatialOS for Unity by launching a cloud deployment of our FPS Starter project. This will introduce you to the workflows and tooling you’ll use with SpatialOS and Unity, allowing you to run your game at scale with up to 200 simulated player-clients running in the cloud.

Once you’ve done this, you’ll then be ready to learn how to build your own features. Our tutorial for adding Health Pickups functionality will introduce you to this development experience.
