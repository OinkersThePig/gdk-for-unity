# Get started

Get started with SpatialOS for Unity by launching a cloud deployment of our FPS Starter project. This will introduce you to the workflows and tooling you’ll use with SpatialOS and Unity, allowing you to run your game at scale with up to 200 simulated player-clients running in the cloud.

There are 5 steps to follow, with a 6th step to check out what the players are doing in your game world.

1. Setup (register for a SpatialOS account, set up your machine and clone the repo)
2. Open and set up the Unity Editor
3. Build your game’s workers via the Unity Editor’s toolbar menu
4. Upload and launch your game with SpatialOS
5. Get playing (and invite friends and add enemies)
6. Check out what’s happening in your game world

It should take you about 10 minutes to get playing.

Once you’ve done this, you’ll then be ready to learn how to build your own features. Our tutorial for adding Health Pickups functionality will introduce you to this development experience.
